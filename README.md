# POKEMON-no-GO
### First Project with Flatiron

This is my  first project with Flatiron school. This program is supposed to be simpler, uglier version of any Pokemon game. 
Once you have the program up and running, you'll be presented a four options:
1. Catch! and you'll will catch a Pokemon
2. Show all - here you can choose to see all the Pokemon that are available for you to catch and their information. 
3. Pokedex - Here you'll be able to see which Pokemon you caught
4. Exit the program.

Choose wisely and please be gentle.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'first-project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install first-project

## Usage

The program uses the website [RANKEDBOOST](https://rankedboost.com/pokemon-go/) to collect all the information. The first level of information is comming from it's Pokedex option (where we get the name and url), and the second level goes into each specific information of each Pokemon. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
